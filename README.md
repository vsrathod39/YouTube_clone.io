## Lessons Learned

While working on this project, I got to know about DOM. I learned about targeting HTML elementsÂ using Javascript, manipulating things on the HTML pages, and re-rendering new elementsÂ as well.
#### Challenges faced: 
I struggledÂ a lot while targeting an HTML element through DOM. It was difficult for me to understandÂ the behavior of DOM. I used to write JS without caring about HTML elements that gave me errors such as can not read property.
